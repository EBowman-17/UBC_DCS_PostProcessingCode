# UBC_DCS_PostProcessingCode
Dual Comb Spectroscopy data post processing library

## Code structure
This is an object oriented approach to analyzing DCS data, all the processed data after processing is complete can be found as 
properties of the object created. Here I will list all the functions in the code structure and explain how to use it and the order they should be called in for tip top data analysis.

## Properties

## Known issues
1. You cannot X out figures other than the absorbance plot

## Things to do
1. Single sided data analysis with Mertz phase correction done in advance (Need to be able to record longer data windows first)
