# UBC_DCS_PostProcessingCode
Dual Comb Spectroscopy data post processing library

## Code structure
This is an object oriented approach to analyzing DCS data, all the processed data after processing is complete can be found as 
properties of the object created.

## Properties

## Known issues
1. You cannot X out figures other than the absorbance plot
2. Haven't tested this with the Frep data built into the meta data file before processing
3. Currently the frequency axis is in MHz but will likely want it in THz or nm
